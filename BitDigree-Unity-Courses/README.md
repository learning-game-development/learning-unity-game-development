## :notebook: Mathematics in Games

1. 2D and 3D co-ordinate system
2. Vector2D and Vector3D (direction and velocity)

## :information_source: Mathematical Formula

### Distance between 2 points

All about [Vectors](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html)

- d = √[(y2 – y1)² + (x1 – x2)²]
- d = √[(y1 – y2)² + (x1 – x2)² + (z1 - z2)²]

### Velocity

- v = d / t

### Projectile motion

- position y = Amplitude * cos (initial angle)

### Pathfinding Algorithms

Unity implements the *Nav Mesh Agent*

- A* search algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm, an uninformed, less powerful special case of the A* search algorithm
- D* family of incremental heuristic search algorithms
- Any-angle path planning algorithms

### Collision

- Rectangle (2D) or box shape (3D) also polygonal, mesh and triangle.
