# Game Distribution

This is where you will build/export your game distribution for all your targeted platforms. Restructure the folders to include builds for testers, reviewers and a playable demo of your game.

```folders
.
└── game/
    ├── demo (working demo to send to reviewers / publishers)
    ├── daily (daily build for testers)
    ├── alfa (internal release)
    ├── beta (controlled public release)
    └── gold (final public release)
        ├── windows
        ├── linux
        └── html5
```
